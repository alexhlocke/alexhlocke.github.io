    <h1>TweetCart Gallery</h1>
    <p>Tweetcarts are a sort of challenge within the Pico-8 communicty to try and fit 
        an entire program (cartridge) inside of a 280 character tweet.
        The program could be anything, but typically people try to make an animation or just something that looks interesting. 
        Because of the strict character limits, you really have to get creative with condensing your code, and as a result,
        programs can be pretty tough to read sometimes. Nonetheless, its a fun challenge and you can do some pretty cool things with 
        just 280 characters of LUA!</p>
    <p>All of the tweetcarts you see here are my own!</p>
